FORMATTED REVIEW:
An interesting local place with river views and good food in the moderate price 
range. It leans heavily toward sea food but there are menu items for the foul 
and bovine inclined. Reservations for diner are a must, particularly on Friday 
and Saturday or any day a popular show is appearing at the Count Basie Theatre. 
Two appetizers and two entrees with nonalcoholic drinks set us back $91 with 
tip. Fairly reasonable. We sat at a lovely set, uncomplicated, table with a 
beautiful view of the Navesink river and it's boat traffic. The service was 
polite, amiable and generally proficient about seeing to our needs. On this day 
I opened with the caprese salad which was very nicely done. The pesto was a 
tasty accent, not over powering. The wet mozzarella perfect and heirloom 
tomatoes glorious. They flavors coming together very nicely. My wife had an 
oyster dish that I'm having a senior moment trying to pull the name from 
memory, however it's sauce was delicious (I'm not a big oyster fan). I kept my 
entree simple: fish and chips. The fish was a nice thick piece of cod, not some 
cod replacement and fried to perfection. The fries were fries. :) My wife had 
the lobster roll, which she gave high marks. Overall a good place to dine 
before a show or after a late afternoon/ early evening walk about. It's not 
child adverse and a few dotted the tables while we were there but, at dinner at 
least, it runs toward an adult crowd. The parking can be difficult on popular 
show nights or Friday evening but the municipal lot is just across the street 
and you don't have to pay after 6pm. It's a thumbs up here.

FORMATTED REVIEW:
Garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever. You feel at home 
right away, he is exciting and passionate, discussions are super interesting 
and he is extremely friendly. A stay at his place is a good mood cure. I highly 
recommend! It was so nice staying at Garon's! For the first glance it didn't 
look very fancy or something, but this place is gorgeous from inside out. It's 
pretty easy to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get 
to A train which goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person, 
very open-minded and friendly! We also have a lot in common in area of culture! 
I'll recommend this place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how 
people live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it was one of the 
coldest weeks for last year in town, but heating worked well and the room was 
warm! "I had the most beautiful stay, Garon is a very special person and an 
absolute angel, made me feel totally at home in a highly peaceful and relaxed 
environment, I throughly recommend Bliss Art Space!

The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city. 
Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty 
throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. This 
apartment is convenient and functional. The huge skylight makes it feel open 
and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. Highly 
recommended. Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet 
and easy going. Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer 
is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. 
We loved the apartment! Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience. 
PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and 
answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & 
zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to 
everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated 
that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone 
coming to explore the city!! "Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great 
host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is 
walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library 
were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk. Best location ever and

UPDATED REVIEW (MORE POSITIVE):
The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city. 
Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty 
throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. This 
apartment is convenient and functional. The huge skylight makes it supportive 
open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. Highly 
recommended. Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet 
and easy going. Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer 
is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. 
We loved the apartment! Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience. 
PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and 
answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & 
zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very delicate & close to 
everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated 
that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone 
coming to explore the city!! "Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great 
host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is 
walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library 
were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk. Best location ever and 
great relaxing place to stay.

FORMATTED REVIEW:
Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We 
spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 
2012) and will remember this time as ours best. The apartment is pretty 
spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is 
everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very 
friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend 
this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the 
center of the boiling Midtown!" We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming 
apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend 
staying at the Midtown Castle!
